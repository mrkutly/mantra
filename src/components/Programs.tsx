							having commissioned and premiered more than 50 new works for
							percussion ensemble over the past decade. The group focuses on

							the landscape of percussion concerts by challenging the standard
							concert format through evening-length events that look toward a
							grander artistic vision.

							throughout North America, Europe and Asia, including the Brooklyn
							Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival, the Bang on a Can Marathon,

						</p>
						<p>

							A professional percussion quartet of BIPOC women, all alumni of
							Mantra Youth Percussion. Arlene Acevedo, Alexis Carter, Tiahna
							Sterling, and Aline Vasquez joined MYP while students at Rahway
							High School. Recap reevaluates the white male-dominated world of
							percussion — Arlene Acevedo explains: “We want to show the world
							that anyone can do this. We’re young women of color doing this...
							and you can too!”
						</p>
						<p>
							Recap releases their debut album, <i>Count to Five</i>, on Innova
							Recordings in September 2021 with music by Angelica Negron,
							Allison Loggins-Hull, Ellen Reid, Lesley Flanigan, Mary
							Kouyoumdjian, and Caroline Shaw. Recap is the headlining artists
							for the 2021 New Music Gathering in Minneapolis, the New Jersey
							Music Educators State Conference, and Mantra Percussion Inc.’s own
							Necessary Noise Festival.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2022, Recap will collaborate with indigenous artists from
							Alaska to present a new hybrid-work that is part performance/part
							documentary with support from Found Sound Nation, the Wildshore
							Festival for New Music, and the United States National Parks
							Service.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recap aims to tour their new repertoire across the globe and to
							inspire other young musicians who might not have considered
							following a path into contemporary arts.
